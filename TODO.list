Go through simulation_construction carefully, looking for the following:

✅. are all methods consistent with new modularization?
✅. are there auxilliary functions that should be removed and placed elsewhere?
✅. make compatible with polar

For polar:
  ✅. For eigenvalue problems, need to pay attention to effect of radial scaling on source term (I think source just goes to sqrt(r)*source)
  ✅. make sure pml works as expected

Boundary matching
  1. Start with 1d
  2. Next polar, this will be the most relevant to RSMs
  3. Next to quasi-1d waveguides

probably skip photonic crystals for now


Other modularization:
  ✅. Linear EigenProblems, should be easily made consistent, orthogonality holds in same way with rescaled field
  1b. NonLinear EigenProblems, should be easily made consistent, orthogonality holds in same way with rescaled field
  ✅. Plotting should be broken down per module, or perhaps should just appear in SimulationTypes
    ✅. Take care of rescaling when plotting Simulation types
  ✅. SimulationTools for all constructors, will be messy but probably not hard to get working at all
    a. PC
    b. Waveguides
  4. Break parallel apart and add to each module
  5. BandStructure module
  6. Dispersion module
  7. Synthesis module
  8. Analysis module, contains S-matrix?
  9. Break pretty_printing apart as well
  10. Make SALT a module
  11. Define a susceptibility object which for now just loads to SALT module
  12. Inhomogeneous problems, which uses Synthesis

  I think that's it!


Temporary path forward:
1. fix up plots
2. verify polar 2d
3. verify 1d
4. verify polar 1d
5. verify pml's
6. implement open boundary conditions for polar
